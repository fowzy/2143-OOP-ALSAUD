## Definitions

#### Abstraction
> Let's think about a car you simply going to run it by using your keys, push the gas to move forward, and control the steering wheel to navigate your car, but you won't care about the details and what's happening inside, as long you know how to use it you should be good. So in OOP, It's all about showing a nice interface and easier way to use, and hide as many details as we can, It makes our program less complex and much easier to fix and maintain. Here is a gif below shows an example about Abstraction:

#### Attributes or Properties
> In real-life car or person has features or properties like a car has its color, model year, engine and person is the same way has their own name, gender, age, and color, etc. The same way goes for classes, every class has its own attributes.

#### Class
> If we have a big project and too many functions built into it! Our code is going to be long and hard to read. it and if we have a problem with our code it's even worse because it's going to be very difficult for us to find that problem, so in order to organize our project, we can cut in small pieces so it becomes easier for the eye to read, become easier to fix, and spot the issues in our code. So class is a template for creating objects in our program, and it will allow us to use these methods and attributes in that class over and over again.

#### Class Variable
> It's any variables declared inside the class.

#### Composition
> Its using smaller object to create a bigger one.

#### Constructor
> It's a member function that gives the class a certain structure, and in c++ we have a default constructor called automatically whenever we created an object.

#### Encapsulation
> Binding all data that functions used.

#### Friends
> It simply makes your class friend with another class and permits it to access private and protected variables.

#### Inheritence
> Let's say I have an existing class called vehicle and this class has properties, and as a programmer, I would like to use these properties and methods in that class and use it in a different class, so to use that I have to use a method called Inheritance and we could inheritance as much as we can.

#### Instance Variable
> It's not a static variables that are defined in the class which object has a separate copy of it.

#### Member Variable
> Any variables associate or works with a method functions inside a class.

#### Method
> It's the member functions inside a class. 

#### Multiple Inheritance
> It's inherit classes more than once.

#### Object
> Object is a data type of a class that has its own state and behavior created by programmers.

#### Overloading
> It's a method will allow you to definde the same method multiple times.

#### Polymorphism
> It's taking multiple copies of our code and giving it different variables or argument 
each version taking a different input. 

#### Public/Private/Protected
> Private are items: variables or functions created inside a class that other classes cannot access directly unless I make these items public or allow some of my functions to change these variables inside that class.
Public: items like functions or variables are created inside a section of a class that other classes will be able to access and communicate with it
Protected can be accessed by inheritence classes.

#### Static
> Static members are initialized only once and this will be shared by all objects has been created.

#### Virtual
> It's a member function and its redefined by derived classes.
