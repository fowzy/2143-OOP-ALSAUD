#### Abstraction
> Let's thing about a car you simply going to run it by using your keys, push the gas to move forward, and control the steering wheel to navigate your car, but you won't care about the details and what's happening inside, as long you know how to use it you should be good. So in OOP It's all about showing a nice interface and easier way to use, and hide as much details as we can, It make our program less complex and much easier to fix and maintenance. Here is a gif below shows an example about Abstraction:

#### Attributes / Properties

#### Class
> If we have a big project and too many functions built into it! Our code it's going to be long and hard too read and looking at it, and if we have a problem in our code it's even worse, so in order to organize our project we can cut in small pieces so it become easier for the eye to read and easy to fix and spot the issues in our code if there is any! So it's a template to create an obejct in our program, and it will allow us to use these methods in that class over and over again.
