## Definitions

#### Abstraction
> It's simply using programer's class, without knowing how that other programmer built it. All we need to know is how to use it and how to implent it to our project. As an example: Riding a car as normal people, we don't need to know how that car built or works from inside! but we need to know how to use it(how to turn on the car and how to use the stairing wheel so we can control the car, etc).
